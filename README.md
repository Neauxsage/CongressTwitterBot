Runs the following scripts in a specific order:

```mermaid
graph LR
bill.py-->pdf.py-->clearXL.py-->del.py-->test.py

```

### bill.py

- Retrieves the current working directory.
- Loads an Excel workbook named 'links.xlsx' and accesses a specific sheet 'text'.
- Extracts a hyperlink from cell A1 of the sheet.
- Parses the URL to create a document title, replacing slashes with hyphens.
- Sets up Selenium WebDriver for Chrome, using ChromeDriverManager for driver management.
- Opens the extracted hyperlink in a Selenium-controlled browser.
- Waits up to 10 seconds for an element with the ID 'bill-summary' to load on the webpage.
- Retrieves the text content of the 'bill-summary' element.
- Closes the Selenium WebDriver.
- Creating and Saving a Word Document:
  - Initializes a new Word document.
  - Adds the retrieved text from the webpage to the document.
  - Saves the Word document in a 'texts' folder within the current working directory, with a filename based on the parsed URL.
- Executing the Script:
  - Runs the main function if the script is executed as the main program.

### pdf.py

- Opens an Excel Workbook
- Accesses a Specific Worksheet
- Parses and Cleans URLs
- Saves Data to Excel
- Web Scraping Setup
- Navigates to a URL
- Extracts Links
- Selects a New Link
- Saves the Original and Cleaned Links
- Closes the Web Browser

### clearXL.py

- Retrieves the current working directory using `os.getcwd()`.
- Constructs the file path for an Excel workbook named 'links.xlsx' located in the current directory.
- Loads the Excel workbook located at the constructed path.
- Selects a sheet within the workbook named "text".
- Deletes all rows in the "text" sheet, effectively clearing all cells.
- Saves the changes made to the workbook.
- Closes the workbook to free up system resources.
- Prints a message indicating the successful clearance of the cells.

### del.py

- Word Count in .docx Files:
  - Defines a function `count_words_in_docx` to count the number of words in a .docx file.
- Listing Files:
  - Lists all the files in the directory ./texts/.
- File Deletion Flag:
  - Initializes a flag `file_deleted` to track if any file is deleted during the script's execution.
- File Processing:
  - Iterates over each file in the ./texts/ directory.
  - For each file ending with .docx (indicating a Word document):
    - Counts the number of words in the document.
    - Prints the file name and its word count.
    - If the word count exceeds 5,000 words:
      - Prints a message indicating the file is being deleted.
      - Deletes the file.
      - Sets the `file_deleted` flag to True.
- Conditional Script Execution:
  - If any file has been deleted (i.e., if `file_deleted` is True), it runs a Python script named all.py.

### test.py

- Initial Setup:
  - Imports necessary libraries.
  - Sets up logging for terminal output.
  - Defines API keys for Tweepy (Twitter API client) and OpenAI.
  - Initializes Tweepy and OpenAI clients.
- Document Processing:
  - Identifies the script's running directory.
  - Retrieves Word documents from a specified 'texts' directory.
  - Randomly selects one of these documents.
  - Reads the selected document and splits its content into chunks.
- Summary Generation:
  - For each chunk of the document, uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate a summary.
  - Handles retries in case of rate limit errors from OpenAI.
  - Combines all chunk summaries into a single text.
- Tweet Generation and Posting:
  - Generates a tweet-sized summary from the combined text, adhering to Twitter's character limit.
  - Posts the tweet using Tweepy if it's within the character limit.
  - Handles errors and excessive attempts in tweet generation.
- File Management:
  - Moves the processed document to an 'archive' directory.
  - Clears the 'texts' directory after processing.
- Spreadsheet Update (Error Handling):
  - In case of a tweet error, deletes all documents in 'texts'.
  - Updates and manages a 'links' spreadsheet, deleting the last row if needed.
